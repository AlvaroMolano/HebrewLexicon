The BDB Outline is being updated.

The intention is to record the entries in the Brown, Driver, Briggs
Hebrew-English Lexicon.  It is broken into parts, for each letter,
sections, for each root printed in large type, and entries, for each
entry in the dictionary, including the roots.  The IDs follow the same
pattern.  Their main purpose is to connect internal references in the
lexicon.  An 'aug' attribute is being added, to map to the augmented
Strong numbers in the Hebrew Lexicon and our WLC.  The update
is close to 40% finished.

The text I'm using is online at 
http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Index:A_Hebrew_and_English_Lexicon_%28Brown-Driver-Briggs%29.djvu
Page numbers can be mapped from the outline to the online pages by
adding 24.  So page 1 can reference
